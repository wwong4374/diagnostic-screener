# Diagnostic Screener

## Problem

Build a full stack web application that allows the user to fill out clinical assessments in the form of multiple choice questions. Each question is associated with a domain (depression, anxiety, etc.), has a title, has a unique ID, and can be answered with a value between 0 and 4, inclusive.

If the sum of a patient's answers for a given domain exceed a certain threshold, we will assign them the corresponding Level 2 Assessment for that domain.
